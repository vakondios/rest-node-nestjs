### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES USED IN DATABASE MODULE.

Here is the list of environment variables that we have used in the `database module`. The variables are as follows.

- **DB_HOST:** It stands for database host. Here we have to write the IP address of the host in which we will be keeping our database. In simple words it can be defined as a SERVER which will contain a pool of databases.


- **DB_DATABASE:** This decides the name of the database which is being hosted at `DB_HOST`.


- **DB_USER:** This decides the name of the user used in the MySQL database. It is essential to create a user in MySQL for accessing and managing the databases.

- **DB_PASSWORD:** This is the password for the `DB_USER`created. If the password is not satisfied then the user will be invalid.

- **DB_PORT:** This defines the port number where the `DB_DATABASE` is hosted.
